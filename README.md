# Dog-Breed-Database
Database app that interfaces with database (created from scratch but now inaccessible) that lets users create, delete, and edit dog breeds in a database. No longer works since I'm not in the class server anymore after completing the class.

In practice, you would need your own db_tunnel file which I didn't include here.
